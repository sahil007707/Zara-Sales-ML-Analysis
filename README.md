# 🛍️ Zara Sales Analysis & Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Welcome to the Zara Sales ML Analysis project! This repository contains a comprehensive end-to-end data science workflow — from **data exploration** to **machine learning modeling** — focused on understanding product clusters and predicting prices based on various features.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project aims to:
- Perform **exploratory data analysis** on Zara's product sales dataset.
- Use **unsupervised learning** techniques to discover hidden patterns (product clusters).
- Engineer meaningful features and visualize high-dimensional data using **PCA and t-SNE**.
- Build **regression models** to predict product prices using supervised learning.

## 🧠 Key Highlights

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Handled missing values and transformed categorical variables.
- Analyzed **distribution of prices**, **product types**, and **sales channels**.
- Visualized feature relationships using:
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `plotly.express`

### 🧪 Feature Engineering
- Label encoding and one-hot encoding applied.
- Dimensionality reduction using:
  - **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**
  - **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**

### 🧬 Clustering
- Used **KMeans Clustering** to group products.
- Identified top-performing product categories within each cluster.

### 📈 Price Prediction Models
Built and evaluated multiple regression models:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge & Lasso Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**

Evaluation metrics used:
- `R² Score`
- `Mean Absolute Error`
- `Root Mean Squared Error`
